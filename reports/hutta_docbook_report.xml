    <title>Work description</title>

    <para>My task in team was to create persistence layer and data access
    objects (DAO). We have decided to use BaseX XML database as a better (in
    our case) alternative of eXistdb. I can't consider myself experienced java
    developer, I have never had experience with most of the technologies we
    have used. That is why I have been given a role of junior developer. Most
    of my work I haven't commit directly to the master branch but instead I
    have used pull requests. </para>

    <para>I was also responsible for managing documentation, updating web
    ApiDoc and updating Github wiki. I have corrected and unified JavaDoc
    comments. Then I have been uploading generated result to our GitHub page
    every time api has changed. Unfortunately, due to my difficult finals,
    lack of time and work on several other projects I wasn't able fully
    complete my responsibilities. So instead creating persistence layer I
    ended up doing auxiliary work, work like writing small pieces of code,
    XQuery expressions etc.</para>

    <para>This was first time I was working on a team project of this size.
    Next time I would have chosen project appropriately to my time and my
    knowledge. </para>
