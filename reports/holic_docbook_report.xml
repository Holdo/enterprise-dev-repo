    <title>Project &amp; work description</title>

    <para>As a <emphasis role="bold">team leader</emphasis> I was responsible
    for organising the project throughout the whole development life-cycle.
    This included creating <emphasis role="bold">GitHub repository</emphasis>
    and <emphasis role="bold">multi-module Maven project</emphasis> along with
    the foundations of the <emphasis role="bold">architecture and
    UML</emphasis>. The goal was to use modern, but standard technologies. The
    following figure illustrates a <emphasis role="bold">component UML
    diagram</emphasis> which I made:</para>

        <title>Architecture design</title>

      </figure></para>

    <para>I chose <emphasis role="bold">Spring</emphasis> as a java container
    because nobody from my team had previous experience with Java l EE, but
    they had experience with Spring. <emphasis role="bold">BaseX</emphasis>
    looked like a faster and better scalable XML database alternative of
    eXistdb. I also created the <emphasis role="bold">logical pair-database
    architecture</emphasis> to differentiate between actual artifacts and
    their extracted metadata. <emphasis role="bold">WebSocket</emphasis> was
    chosen as a protocol instead of REST because REST does not support binary
    data transfers.</para>

    <para>The main piece of work I did was frontend based on <emphasis
    role="bold">OpenUI5</emphasis> MVC framework with following
    settings:<itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">M</emphasis> - JSON data model
          supporting two-way binding</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">V</emphasis> - XML document view
          supported by <link
          xlink:href="https://github.com/Holdo/enterprise-dev-repo/tree/master/webmvc/src/main/xsd">XSDs</link></para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">C</emphasis> - Javascript controller
          with reactive programming support</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>The final frontend is responsive and tested in Internet
    Explorer 11, Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome. Some additional javascript
    libraries were used like <emphasis role="bold">highlight.js</emphasis> for
    highlighting XML text and <emphasis role="bold">spin.js</emphasis> for
    showing a spinner to the user while loading OpenUI5 asynchronously.</para>

    <para>As a team leader I was also there to help my team members, sometimes
    doing some java work and well... a lot of refactoring and bug fixing.
    Unfortunately one of my team members, Tomáš Rybenský, was unable to find
    time for the project and raised the white flag.</para>
