Our project intends to not only deliver these functions needed by the Enterprise Middleware industry, but to deliver them in a modern, high-speed and reliable fashion.\r\n\r\n### Technology behind the curtain\r\nRed Hat's [Undertow web server](http://blog.arungupta.me/undertow-benchmarks-wildfly/) winning performance benchmarks combined with [WebSocket protocol](http://www.websocket.org/aboutwebsocket.html) promises fast web interaction. Embedded [BaseX XML database](http://basex.org/) on the backend provides standardized XQuery document access and good scalability. Also we don't forget about user experience as well... that's why we've bet on a modern [OpenUI5 MVC](http://openui5.org/) JavaScript framework built upon JQuery, which supports responsive one-page client side applications with two-way XML/JSON/ODATA binding.\r\n\r\n### Architecture design\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10115368/16357342/221be8f4-3af4-11e6-844b-7a66517eb0cc.png)\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThis project started at the Masaryk University as a part of PB138 course. Developers are:\r\n* Michal Holič\r\n* Ondřej Gasior\r\n* Peter Hutta\r\n\r\n[DocBook work reports](https://github.com/Holdo/enterprise-dev-repo/tree/gh-pages/reports)",
